1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,077
Not the headline I was hoping for
a week before the election.

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,437
Nobody's that squeaky-clean.
We'll find something to use against him.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,153
You've never met Jonathan Kent.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,197
Mr. Luthor?

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,795
- We need to get you out of here.
- What's going on?

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,155
There's been a bomb threat.
We need to evacuate.

7
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,273
- A bomb?
- My security didn't alert me about this.

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,518
Lex?

9
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,029
You always gotta do things
the hard way, don't you?

10
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,151
Let me guess, you're not a cop.

11
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,833
Not anymore.

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,158
Stop him.

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,957
<i>At the risk of stating the obvious...</i>

14
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,633
...but whatever game
you think you're <i>playing...</i>

15
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,948
...you just lost.

16
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,953
If you're trying the hard-wire,
good luck.

17
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,835
<i>I cut it a half-hour ago. Right around</i>
<i>the time I set up the wireless scrambler.</i>

18
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,349
Looks like the game is just starting.

19
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,832
- What do you want?
- I'll give you a hint.

20
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,439
It's <i>big...</i>

21
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,074
<i>... metallic,</i>
<i>it came from outer space.</i>

22
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,396
I don't know what
you're talking about.

23
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,839
<i>Sure you do.</i>

24
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,793
<i>I want that ship</i>
<i>that landed in the meteor shower.</i>

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,596
<i>Or that room is gonna be your coffin,</i>
<i>Luthor.</i>

26
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,711
Okay, so when you said,
"Let's get together and study" <i>...</i>

27
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,195
...you actually meant study.

28
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,199
Kiss me.

29
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,238
Clark, what am I, your cousin?

30
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,192
Really kiss me.

31
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,556
I gotta go. I don't wanna miss class.

32
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,591
Wouldn't want you
to be late for class.

33
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,268
- Lana, come on.
- Clark, what is it?

34
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,278
When we kiss, when we really kiss...

35
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,359
...I can feel how much you want me.
Why can't we just be together?

36
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,233
It's complicated.

37
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,358
It shouldn't be.

38
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,755
Not when you love somebody.

39
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,072
Lana, wait.

40
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,153
What is this?

41
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,874
Nothing.

42
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,313
Did you get this from Lex?

43
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,232
We've been researching it together
for the last couple of weeks.

44
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,713
Why would you keep this from me?

45
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,352
Because, Clark...

46
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,553
...every time I try to bring up the ship
I saw, you change the subject.

47
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,792
Just don't think there's any point
in dwelling on it.

48
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,749
I saw what came out of that ship.

49
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,109
I watched them kill
all those police officers.

50
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,513
I almost died,
and all you can say to me is:

51
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,950
"There's no point in dwelling on it"?

52
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,633
I turned to Lex because he wants
to find out the truth...

53
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,071
...not avoid it.

54
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,472
A spaceship?

55
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,275
Have you tried the amusement park?
They have one you can ride for a dollar.

56
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,238
I know you took that ship
after the meteor shower, Luthor.

57
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,550
You do realize
how crazy you sound right now.

58
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,157
Does this look crazy to you?

59
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,633
<i>I was there.</i>

60
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,510
<i>I was part of the Sheriff's Response</i>
<i>Team that got wiped out.</i>

61
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,193
I was under my cruiser, half dead.

62
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,550
<i>I saw you roll up</i>
<i>with your equipment and men.</i>

63
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,110
<i>You didn 't even bother to see</i>
<i>if anybody was still alive.</i>

64
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,752
All you cared about
was hauling that ship away.

65
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,074
Sorry, but I still don't know
what you're talking about.

66
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,232
<i>You're going to make a great politician,</i>
<i>Luthor.</i>

67
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,034
<i>You almost sound like you believe</i>
<i>your own lies.</i>

68
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,510
You want to make it to Election Day?

69
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,910
- Tell me what I want to know.
- <i>Or what?</i>

70
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,079
I had this room designed after that
little incident at the missile silo.

71
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,397
These walls can withstand
a nuclear blast. You'll never get in here.

72
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,073
<i>And you'll never get out.</i>

73
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,834
Your security team's tied up
in the basement.

74
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,473
<i>Your wireless system 's blocked.</i>

75
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,989
<i>You won 't be sending up</i>
<i>any smoke signals for help.</i>

76
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,116
Looks like we have ourselves
a stalemate.

77
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,080
Well, I guess I'll have to find
a way to break it.

78
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,516
Lana's helping Lex
study the black ship?

79
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,756
She's got a detailed drawing from
LuthorCorp.

80
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,638
She's been lying to me for weeks.

81
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,673
Well, you haven't exactly been honest
with her either, Clark.

82
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,111
Sometimes the truth isn't easy to share
with the one you love.

83
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,077
Especially if you think it might hurt.

84
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,118
Everything was so perfect with Lana
when I lost my abilities.

85
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,397
Now that I have them back,
all I do is lie to her.

86
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,990
About the ship, about why l...

87
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,719
I just wish I could tell her.

88
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,633
I'm not saying you should,
but Pete found out, and Chloe...

89
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,751
...and they accepted you
for who you are.

90
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,758
- Yeah. I'm an alien.
- No, as their friend.

91
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,032
Whom they love very much no matter
what star you were born under.

92
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,629
Just not sure Lana's gonna feel
the same way.

93
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,439
Then maybe she's not the one
you were meant to be with.

94
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,434
Mom, I can't imagine
ever loving anyone else.

95
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,829
Hey, Smallville, Mrs. Kent.

96
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,276
Have you guys seen the future senator?
It's crunch time.

97
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,989
- We've got some billionaire butt to kick.
- I think he's in the barn, Lois.

98
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,752
Salt of the earth. Voters love that.

99
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,358
Turn that frown upside down, Skippy.

100
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,030
All right? Unhappy family members
reflect badly at the polls.

101
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,358
I'm looking forward to this campaign
being over.

102
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,028
This isn't about numbers,
demographics or projections.

103
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,312
It's about giving everybody the chance
to live a life with dignity.

104
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,954
Whether they have a dollar in the bank,
or a million.

105
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,233
That's why I got involved in the senate
race and that's why I intend to win.

106
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:09,116
Regardless of my opponent's checkbook,
I don't care how big it is.

107
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,151
Listen, if you need
any more comment...

108
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,436
...call my campaign manager,
Lois Lane.

109
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,795
She'll talk to you, all right? Thanks.

110
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,389
You're getting very smooth
with the interviews.

111
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,314
I've had a lot of practice. I feel like
I got a phone growing out of my ear.

112
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,995
Well, you're doing great.
Homestretch, senator.

113
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,509
I'm not the senator,
I haven't won anything yet.

114
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,917
Well, you will when I'm done.
Here we are. This is what we're doing.

115
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,918
Print ads in all the papers,
radio spots across the dial...

116
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,793
...billboards littering the interstate
like roadkill...

117
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,595
...and the nail that is going to
close the coffin...

118
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,995
<i>...on</i> our bald-headed wannabe's
campaign...

119
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,474
...the heartland message...

120
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,679
...on every TV station across Kansas
from now until Election Day.

121
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,440
Well, it sounds like somebody I know
needs a raise.

122
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,598
Technically,
you'd have to start paying me first.

123
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,236
Lois, this is all really fantastic,
but how can we afford it?

124
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,395
You know what,
don't even bother with the details.

125
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,239
You just need to shake hands
and kiss babies, all right?

126
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,477
Let's talk about your schedule
from now till Election Day.

127
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,512
- You're gonna be one busy guy.
- Yeah.

128
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,917
I know how he feels about Lex,
but what am I supposed to do, Chloe?

129
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,839
It's like there's this part of clark
that just shuts down...

130
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,952
...anytime I start talking about
the meteors or what I saw.

131
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,478
Okay, let me just call you back
in a second, all right?

132
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,832
I'm sorry, officer,
I know I was driving a little bit fast.

133
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,719
That's the least of your problems,
Miss Lang.

134
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,757
<i>What are you doing?</i>

135
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,638
<i>Shut your mouth.</i>

136
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,554
Lana?

137
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,318
- Let her go.
- <i>Lex?</i>

138
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,794
I said, let her go.

139
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,753
<i>Remember that stalemate</i>
<i>you were talking about, Luthor?</i>

140
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,833
- Lex, why are they doing this?
- Yeah, Lex, why all the fuss?

141
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,112
Lana, they're looking for a spaceship.

142
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,439
- What spaceship?
- Is everybody stupid around here?

143
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,636
Tell us where it is
and all this is over.

144
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,512
She doesn't know anything.

145
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,915
Yeah, well, she was there
when it crashed.

146
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,317
And I know you two have been
spending an awful lot of time together.

147
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,911
So get your ass out here now
or you'll be talking to yourself.

148
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,789
I guess you're not as important
after all.

149
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,078
Step out.

150
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,753
Check him.

151
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,999
Don't worry, Lana.
I'm not gonna let this psycho hurt you.

152
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,838
You think you can stop me, Luthor?

153
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,555
- You all right? You hurt?
- No, I'm okay.

154
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,320
I warned you knowing about that ship
could be dangerous.

155
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,959
Lex.

156
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,470
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Lex.

157
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,351
Oh, my God.

158
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,796
Come on, Bob,
you can do better than this.

159
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,753
I know it's 30 seconds
smack in the middle of prime time...

160
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,678
...that's why it's called "prime."

161
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,270
Drop 10 grand and I promise you,
I will get you a personal invitation...

162
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,835
<i>...to</i> Senator Kent's election party.

163
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,553
I'll save you a dance. Thanks, Bob.

164
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,834
Wow, prime time.
That must have cost a bit, huh?

165
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,554
Feminine wiles.
Bob's got a crush on me.

166
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,115
Parts of me.
He let me have it for next to nothing.

167
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,515
I wonder if all you nice people
wouldn't <i>mind...</i>

168
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,477
...giving Miss Lane and I
a few minutes?

169
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,473
Why don't you get yourself
a cup of coffee.

170
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,238
Thank you.

171
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,278
Wow, "Miss Lane."
I'm feeling all professional.

172
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,069
You've really grown into your role
well here, Lois.

173
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,192
Like the way you managed
to get all this last-minute publicity.

174
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,634
That's very impressive.

175
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,039
Thanks, boss.

176
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,157
It also must be very expensive.

177
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,680
I told you not to bother with that,
I've got it covered.

178
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,996
Yeah, you see, that's my problem.

179
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,237
I'm crunching the numbers,
they don't seem to add up, Lois.

180
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,391
We're spending more than we have.

181
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,831
A lot more.

182
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,670
- Well, I just called in a few favors.
- Lois.

183
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,509
I appreciate everything you're doing,
I really do.

184
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,518
But you've got to stop
sidestepping my question.

185
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,199
Where's the money coming from?

186
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,839
Lionel Luthor.

187
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,474
I didn't have a choice.

188
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,870
The well ran dry,
and without Lionel's <i>backing...</i>

189
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,235
...our campaign would have folded
weeks ago.

190
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,839
It was the right thing to do.

191
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,195
We actually have a chance
to win this thing now.

192
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,868
What is the point
if the devil owns your soul?

193
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,393
It's not like that.

194
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,154
He doesn't want anything from you.
This is about Lex.

195
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,432
Lionel's gonna do anything he can
to stop Lex from becoming senator.

196
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,712
I'm sure that that's true.
But you don't know Lionel like I do.

197
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,957
He doesn't give anyone
anything for free. There's always a price.

198
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,197
I'm the one that's
gonna have to pay it.

199
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,832
Clark...

200
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,392
...can you put on the brakes
before you tornado my homework?

201
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,198
I'm sorry.

202
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,556
All right, Dostoyevsky's <i>Idiot</i> isn't
gonna get any smarter, so come on...

203
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,758
<i>...Miss</i> Sullivan's advice column
is open for letters.

204
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,474
Lana and I had another fight.

205
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,513
I know, she called me
right after the big blowout.

206
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,474
What did she say?

207
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,719
Just the headlines: Spaceship, boyfriend
that always changes the subject...

208
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,150
...forced to turn to
everyone's favorite villain.

209
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,078
How long has she been
working on this?

210
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,636
I don't know, actually.
This is the first I've ever heard of it.

211
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,273
You have to find out
how long they've been working together.

212
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,118
Are you asking me to spy on Lana?

213
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,393
- It's very important.
- I understand, and you're my <i>friend...</i>

214
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,030
...but so is Lana, and there is no way
I'm getting in the middle of this.

215
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,598
Is that Lana?

216
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,274
Hello? Yes, this is Chloe Sullivan.

217
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,072
Where?

218
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,399
No. No, she hasn't been back
to the dorm at all.

219
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,314
Yeah, I will, I will. Thank you.

220
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,278
What happened?

221
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,393
That was the Smallville
Sheriff's Department.

222
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,474
Something wrong?

223
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,036
They found Lana's car
abandoned on the side of the road.

224
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,316
Start a perimeter search. See if you
can find anything out in that field.

225
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,158
Sheriff?

226
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,796
Mr. Kent, what did you do,
drop out of the sky?

227
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,514
- Where's Lana?
- That's what we're trying to find out.

228
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,030
- When was the last time you saw her?
- Couple of hours ago.

229
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,953
- We had a fight.
- Well, that's what people in love <i>do...</i>

230
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,394
...then they make up...

231
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,273
...which I aim to give you
and Miss Lang the chance to do.

232
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,995
We found her purse, everything's in it.
And the car speaks for itself.

233
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,556
I'd peg this as a kidnapping
but there's no sign of a <i>struggle...</i>

234
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,912
...which suggests she either knew
her assailant or was caught off-guard.

235
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,269
Either way, we'll go over
every inch of the scene...

236
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,590
...until we dust off
something useful...

237
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,674
Sheriff.

238
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,076
It's a GPS.

239
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,074
Someone must have been
following her.

240
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,993
How in the Sam Spade
did you know where to find this?

241
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,630
- Just a hunch.
- You got an awful lot of those.

242
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,957
I've said it before, but I could use
a man like you on the force...

243
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,878
...instead of some of these hayseeds.

244
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:03,313
There's a serial number on here,
"511 GKL97."

245
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,953
So I think maybe...

246
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,633
Sheriff.

247
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,389
We got a silent alarm
from up at the Luthor mansion.

248
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,677
- Harris is checking it out.
- Harris, what's your situation?

249
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,916
All clear, sheriff.

250
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,157
Looks like it was a false alarm.

251
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,232
Okay, keep searching the perimeter.

252
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,356
You get anything,
you get me on the horn.

253
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,831
<i>Getting a little warm in there?</i>

254
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,508
<i>I hacked into the climate controls.</i>

255
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,678
<i>Should hit about a buck thirty</i>
<i>in half an hour.</i>

256
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,838
<i>Give me a yell</i>
<i>when you're medium rare.</i>

257
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,671
<i>By the way, how's that bullet feel?</i>
<i>I know I got you.</i>

258
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,440
- I can't stop it.
- It's okay.

259
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,119
They'll be here soon.

260
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,517
- Who?
- The police.

261
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,990
Barney Fife out there
was using a scrambler...

262
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,549
...to block the wireless backup alarm.

263
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,796
That's what you were shooting at.

264
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,990
If we were at the fair,
I would have won you a stuffed giraffe.

265
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,954
I would've liked that a lot more than
you getting shot trying to protect me.

266
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,592
I was just trying to get us
back into the panic room.

267
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,110
I know what you did, Lex.

268
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,159
Thank you.

269
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,519
Lana...

270
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,752
<i>...I'm</i> sorry
that you got sucked into this.

271
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,394
Why didn't you just tell them
where the spaceship was?

272
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,278
This isn't worth your life.

273
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,674
I can't tell them the <i>truth...</i>

274
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,838
...because they'd kill both of us.

275
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,192
<i>Mr. Luthor?</i>

276
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,228
I don't think they'll get the chance.

277
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,633
- Sheriff, what are you doing here?
- Out for a stroll. What do you think?

278
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,111
I already told you
it was a false alarm.

279
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,357
Coming from the mansion of a billionaire
running for state senate?

280
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,115
Luthor manages to get himself elected,
I don't want him chewing my <i>backside...</i>

281
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,874
...for not showing up to hold his hand.
Now, where is he?

282
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,594
- Out, I guess. I haven't...
- Out?

283
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,475
You don't stand down an alarm without
talking to the primary resident, Harris.

284
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,955
Now get your head in the game.

285
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,036
Sheriff.

286
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,639
Flynn?

287
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,430
Well, ain't that a mother.

288
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,517
Why is this taking so long?

289
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,559
Well, getting past the server's firewall
and the encryption protocol takes time.

290
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,156
Sorry, clark, but I don't have
a super-speed mode. Get out of here.

291
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,955
But I am the slickest blond
you'll ever meet.

292
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,716
Okay, so it looks like the serial number
for the GPS you found...

293
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,474
...matches a unit sold
to a Gregory Flynn.

294
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,914
What do you got on him?

295
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,594
In a couple of seconds, everything.

296
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,271
Clark, Lana's gonna be okay.

297
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,795
She has you, doesn't she?

298
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,789
Oh, here we go. "Flynn, Gregory R."

299
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,872
He's a Smallville sheriff's officer.

300
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,475
Yeah, up until a couple of months ago.

301
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,712
He was put on psychiatric leave
because he was wounded...

302
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,873
...and his entire unit was killed during
the meteor shower.

303
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,751
He was there when
the spaceship landed.

304
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,636
- When those Kryptonians killed everyone.
- Yeah, but Flynn survived the attack.

305
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,751
God, seeing something like that.
I mean...

306
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,115
...all those people you work with,
your friends.

307
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,555
No wonder he had a psychotic break.
Let's go.

308
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,678
- Why would he kidnap Lana?
- I don't know, but she was there too.

309
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,229
I thought maybe if we can get
his psych workup...

310
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,630
...we can figure out
what it is that he's up to.

311
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,472
Yeah.

312
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:00,152
I can't believe Lois would take money
from Lionel behind my back.

313
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,710
- She has no idea what he's capable of.
- It wasn't her fault.

314
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,791
Martha, please.
Don't defend her to me.

315
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,076
I'm not.

316
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,598
I took the money from Lionel.

317
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,879
How could you do that?

318
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,231
Because I know how much
this means to you, Jonathan.

319
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,994
To be able to make
a real difference in the world...

320
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,913
...the way our son does everyday.

321
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,874
I love you so much.

322
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,952
I don't want you to lose
because Lex has a bigger bank account.

323
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,238
I promised the only people I would owe
were the people who voted for me.

324
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,756
Now that I've taken it, I'm no different
than any other lying politician.

325
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,037
You think the Farmers Association
and the Rotary Club...

326
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,909
...and everyone else who gave
you money won't be asking for favors?

327
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,798
They can ask anything that they want.

328
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,520
But I won't do something
I don't believe in.

329
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,838
Then why should it be
any different with Lionel?

330
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,351
Martha, you know it's not the same.

331
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,751
I know nothing is black or white,
especially in politics.

332
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,797
If you win this election...

333
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,794
...you'll be able to help so many people
who desperately need it.

334
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,236
Please, don't let your pride
get in the way.

335
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,154
<i>How many more people</i>
<i>have to die for this?</i>

336
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,193
<i>As many as it takes.</i>
<i>Luthor can 't last much longer in there.</i>

337
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,828
<i>He'll bleed out</i>
<i>if he doesn 't open that door.</i>

338
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,629
Lex. Hey, hey, come on. Wake up.

339
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,073
You're in shock.

340
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,196
Stay conscious or else
you might die. Okay?

341
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,078
All right.

342
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,151
Okay, well, tell me something.

343
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:44,193
- What?
- Anything. Just keep talking, okay?

344
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,753
You think I'd look better with hair?

345
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,435
I don't know.
I've never thought about it.

346
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:02,475
Oh, I have.
I've thought about a lot of things.

347
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,916
Clark has really nice hair.

348
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,957
Yeah. Yeah, I guess he does.

349
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,357
- Does he know?
- That he has nice hair?

350
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,835
How lucky he is.

351
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,514
I had a dream once, Lana.

352
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,669
About how different things could be.

353
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,189
It was Christmas.

354
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,554
Clark and I were friends again.

355
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,875
Well, that sounds really nice.

356
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,598
You were in my dream too.

357
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,117
I was?

358
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,676
You were the best part about it.

359
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,788
Lex. Lex, we have
to get you out of here, all right?

360
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,235
Just give them what they want.

361
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,153
I can't tell them where it is.

362
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,313
This spaceship isn't gonna make
any difference if you're dead.

363
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,798
I can't tell them where it is
because I honestly don't know.

364
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,034
What?

365
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,277
One minute it was there
and the next...

366
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,750
Nothing but static on the security
cameras and an empty warehouse.

367
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,717
I'm sorry.

368
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,199
How long have you known this?

369
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,951
A few weeks.

370
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,149
Lex, how could you have lied
to me this entire time?

371
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,596
Because I didn't know
how to tell you the truth, Lana.

372
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,228
Your life, mine.

373
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,152
They've both been affected
so much by these meteors.

374
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,230
That ship was our one chance
to understand why.

375
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:00,519
I was hoping
that I might find it again before...

376
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,429
I should have been honest with you.

377
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,594
Lex?

378
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,077
Lex. Lex. Oh, God.

379
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,552
Lex, Lex, please don't... Stay awake.
Lex, please. Please, wake up.

380
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,870
Oh, God.

381
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:32,194
I'll tell you where the ship is. But first
you have to get Lex help. He's hurt.

382
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,313
I've seen worse.

383
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,313
Call for help, and I'll tell you where it is.
That's the deal.

384
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,711
Well, I'm making a new deal. Take me
to the ship. Then I make the call.

385
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,757
Lana, don't.

386
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,152
All right.

387
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,358
Okay, this is what we're gonna do.
You're gonna wait here.

388
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,149
I'll double back and see if I can hack
into the visitors list to get us passes.

389
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:21,552
Then we can come back in and maybe
get right by that guy right there.

390
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,273
I got it.

391
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,711
What did you do?

392
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,636
Super shake.

393
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,837
Not bad. Not bad.

394
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,473
<i>- I am not crazy.</i>
<i>- No one's saying that.</i>

395
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,358
<i>Then why won 't you believe me?</i>

396
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,988
<i>I saw a ship crash</i>
<i>in the meteor shower.</i>

397
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,594
<i>I saw what came out of it.</i>

398
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,990
<i>- Gregory...</i>
<i>- They hit us with some heat beams...</i>

399
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:12,030
<i>... from their eyes.</i>
<i>Took out the cars and the helicopter.</i>

400
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,113
<i>I was pinned.</i>

401
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,874
<i>I could smell something burning.</i>

402
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,110
<i>It was me.</i>

403
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,635
<i>I was burning.</i>

404
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,072
<i>Didn 't scream, didn 't make a sound</i>
<i>because they would've seen me.</i>

405
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,670
<i>- Who?</i>
<i>- Those things from the ship.</i>

406
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,273
<i>They killed everyone.</i>

407
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,635
<i>Everyone except the girl.</i>
<i>She got away.</i>

408
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,398
- <i>We've been over this.</i>
- Lana.

409
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,034
<i>There is no ship.</i>
<i>Your team was hit by a meteor.</i>

410
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,270
<i>That's what he wants you to believe!</i>

411
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,109
<i>I saw him take the ship!</i>

412
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,158
<i>I am not crazy!</i>

413
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,949
<i>Ask Lex Luthor!</i>
<i>He knows the truth! He has the ship!</i>

414
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,673
Lex.

415
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,230
Clark, that's where they must be.

416
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,668
Damn, I wish I could do that.

417
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,638
Sheriff?

418
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,192
Lex.

419
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,278
Lex?

420
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,115
We're here.
Make the call and get Lex help.

421
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,554
After I see the ship.

422
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,837
What are you gonna do? Climb inside
and fly away? There's no way in.

423
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,514
Oh, we don't plan to.

424
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,240
You don't want to take the ship.
You want to destroy it.

425
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,038
That thing crashed from outer space.

426
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,191
Couple of pounds
of c-4 wouldn't dent it.

427
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,669
But it will make an awful lot of noise.

428
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:54,071
Police, fire, news crews,
they'll all come running.

429
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,719
And they'll see it.

430
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,793
Just like us. Only difference is,
you kept quiet and I told the truth.

431
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,315
And they sent him
to a psych ward for it.

432
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,278
And they wouldn't even let me see him,
his own fiancée.

433
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,715
People need to be warned
before more of them land.

434
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,472
It's the right thing to do.

435
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,437
Tell Sheriff Adams that.

436
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,229
- Where is it?
- I don't know.

437
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,119
It was here before. I swear it was.

438
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,030
Don't lie to me.

439
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,789
Lex. Lex! Where's Lana?

440
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,070
- Get him out of here!
- Tell me where she is.

441
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,351
Warehouse 15.

442
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,518
- Greg.
- Get the case.

443
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,079
We gotta get the case.

444
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,913
- The what?
- The case!

445
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,152
Greg. Greg...

446
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,151
- I got it.
- No, we gotta get out of here.

447
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,313
- I got it.
- Greg. We have to get out of here!

448
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,079
Come on!

449
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,630
- Lana.
- Clark?

450
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,074
What happened?

451
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,915
I don't know.
Lex told me where to find you.

452
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,833
When I got here,
you were laying on the ground.

453
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,956
I don't understand.

454
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:33,237
You're alive. That's all that matters.

455
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,360
She knows where the spaceship is.
Don't let her lie!

456
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,557
She's working with Luthor!
She knows everything!

457
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,271
What a nut.

458
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,838
How you doing?

459
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,834
Doing all right,
considering I almost got blown up.

460
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,710
I can't believe Lex would risk your life.

461
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,348
- Clark...
- He knew there was no ship in there.

462
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,472
Clark, it wasn't his idea.
I brought them here on my own.

463
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:15,151
- You did?
- It was my only chance to get Lex help.

464
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,279
You risked your life for Lex?

465
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,631
He did the same thing for me
back at the mansion.

466
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,156
Clark, if it wasn't for him,
I'd probably be dead.

467
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,315
Lex saved my life.

468
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,957
<i>A good neighbor, a man who knows</i>
<i>the value of an honest day's work...</i>

469
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,554
<i>... and the responsibility of family.</i>

470
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,109
- <i>Jonathan Kent...</i>
- What did you think?

471
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:46,238
I think the flag might have
been a bit much, don't you?

472
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,908
Nothing says America
like the Stars and Stripes.

473
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,637
Except maybe the name
Jonathan Kent.

474
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,156
I'm sorry I accepted Lionel's contribution
without asking you first.

475
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,834
- It was wrong. I shouldn't have done it.
- Lois. Lois.

476
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,359
He knows.

477
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,710
- He does?
- Yeah.

478
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,111
I know. Martha told me that
she's the one that accepted the money.

479
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,953
It's a fact you might've shared
when I was yelling at you.

480
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,438
Well, the decision to use it
was still mine.

481
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:18,036
Look, I think you are going to be
a great senator, Mr. Kent.

482
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,715
But the hard truth is you wouldn't have
a chance without Lionel's money.

483
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,993
No, Lois. The hard truth is...

484
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:28,948
<i>...by</i> taking it, I'm no longer the man
that you just saw on television.

485
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,588
And I'm no longer the man
you married.

486
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,510
That's why I've decided to pay back
Lionel Luthor every cent he loaned us.

487
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,713
How? Not having any green
is what put us in this hole.

488
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,758
I sold the back 40 this morning.

489
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,997
Jonathan, that land has been
in your family for generations.

490
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,833
Yeah, and I've never done
a thing with it, sweetheart.

491
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:58,078
I should have sold it years ago.
I was just too proud. I'm sorry.

492
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:05,276
I know it's not the whole thing,
but it's certainly a start. Here you go.

493
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,156
Well, I'll do everything I can
to help you.

494
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:12,079
I never doubted that, sweetie.

495
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,198
So, what happens in the meantime?

496
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,954
If you're right,
Lionel will want something from you.

497
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:22,749
I'll find out soon enough. But right now,
we have an election to win.

498
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,591
Absolutely.

499
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,475
That doesn't look like bed rest.

500
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,749
Yeah. I was never really good
at taking things lying down.

501
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,117
Well, you are a Luthor.

502
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,353
Yeah.

503
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,150
I guess I am.

504
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,512
Lana...

505
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,671
<i>...I'm</i> sorry I didn't tell you
about losing the ship.

506
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,439
Wouldn't matter. It'd still be gone.

507
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,830
Yeah, well, at least
you wouldn't hate me for it.

508
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,158
I don't hate you, Lex.

509
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,630
How could I after you risked your life
to save mine?

510
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,638
You're one of the few
good things in my life.

511
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,877
I hope that won't change.

512
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,275
Well, that depends on you.

513
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,916
All I ever asked for was the truth.

514
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:44,476
And that's all you'll ever get
from me from now on.

515
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,356
I promise.

516
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,393
Lana, we may not have the ship...

517
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,791
<i>...but</i> that doesn't mean
we can't keep trying to find it.

518
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,918
And solve all the mysteries
that go with it.

519
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,279
Partners?

520
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,399
No.

521
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,159
Let's try being friends.

522
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:48,628
- What is it?
- It's nothing.

523
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,870
The only reason Lana almost got killed
was because of Lex.

524
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,792
Lana can make her own decisions.

525
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,110
I'm not saying she can't,
but we all know Lex.

526
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,999
He twists everything
until you don't know what to believe.

527
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,799
Oh, no, Lex is a snake.
Believe me, I've seen his scales.

528
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,679
But he did almost die taking
a bullet for Lana.

529
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,910
- I saved her. Does that mean anything?
- Yeah.

530
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,196
You know what?
It would, if she knew about it.

531
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,669
The only reason Lana started
talking to Lex...

532
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,115
...was to learn more
about that spaceship.

533
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,271
If I was honest,
she never would've had to.

534
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,237
No, she wouldn't.

535
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,989
I love her so much, Chloe.

536
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,552
I know.

537
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,319
But all you're doing now
is pushing her further away.

538
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,556
That's not what I want.

539
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,469
I want us to be together
for the rest of our lives.

540
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,472
The only way that's ever gonna happen
is if you tell her the truth.
